# Simple Site

A bootstrap folder that I use when throwing together simple sites.  This allows me to get up and running quickly using HAML, SASS, CoffeeScript, Compass, Susy and a few default styles.

To run the site locally with 

    bundle exec rackup config.ru

If you want to compile the assets without running the server, run

    bundle exec rakep
