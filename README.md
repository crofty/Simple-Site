# Simple Site

A bootstrap folder that I use when throwing together simple sites.  This allows me to get up and running quickly using HAML, SASS, CoffeeScript, Compass, Susy and a few default styles.

To run the site locally with 

    foreman start

If you want to compile the assets without running the server, run

    bundle exec rakep


The site uses styles from the scss version of twitter bootstrap, the styles are grabbed from this repo: git://github.com/yury/bootstrap.git
